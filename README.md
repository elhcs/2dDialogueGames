## Project Overview

**2D Dialogue Games** is an interactive prototype designed to simulate engaging dialogue-based interactions within a 2D environment. Initially developed to showcase at hackathons and business accelerator events, this project aims to demonstrate the potential of a dynamic dialogue system within a gaming framework.

## Disclaimer

> **Note**: The current version of **2D Dialogue Games** on this GitHub repository is a **mockup prototype** created on the first day of the project. It was designed to serve as a preliminary concept for presentations and demos. I am actively working on further development, and future versions will introduce enhanced features and incorporate cutting-edge AI algorithms to improve interactivity and user experience.

## Future Plans

My teammates and I are dedicated to building upon this initial mockup and are exploring several advanced features:
- **State-of-the-art AI Algorithms**: Incorporating natural language processing and machine learning for improved dialogue dynamics and realism.
- **Expanded Feature Set**: Introducing new gameplay mechanics, branching storylines, and richer character interactions.
- **3D Object Generator**: Developing a 3D object generation tool to allow the inclusion of custom, procedurally generated 3D assets, enriching the game world and enhancing the visual experience.

Stay tuned for updates and more robust versions as we progress!
